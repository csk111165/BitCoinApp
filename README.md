This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

## Notes
* If we want to import only specific class from module we use show/hide with import
* show will show that specific module
* hide will not import that specific module
* http package need to be installed via : `dart pub add http` it will automatically update the pubspec.yaml file
* for generating the api key we can use some temp mail, instead of giving them gmail id, such as temp-mail.org
